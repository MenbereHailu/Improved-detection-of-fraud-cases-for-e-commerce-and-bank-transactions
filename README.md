# 🛡️ Fraud Detection System - Adey Innovations Inc.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to build accurate, explainable fraud detection models using data from both:
- E-commerce transactions
- Banking credit card transactions

By combining geolocation, transaction velocity, and machine learning, the system enhances real-time fraud prevention.

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt



📊 Key Features
📦 Multiple Data Sources: Fraud_Data.csv, creditcard.csv, IpAddress_to_Country.csv

🌍 Geo-Mapping: Country-based fraud patterns

⏱️ Time & Velocity Features: Detect unusual behavior over time

⚖️ Imbalance Handling: SMOTE and class-weighted training

🧠 Explainability: SHAP to visualize how the model makes decisions

✅ Interim Progress (Week 1)
